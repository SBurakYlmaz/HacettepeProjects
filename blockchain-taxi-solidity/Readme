Assumptions : 
1. In order to deploy the contract adjust gas Limit 4000000.
2. One month equals 30 days.
3. To get correct results we should try unixTimestamp on date or time fields such as offeredValidTime (ex. 1618755803 == 04/18/2021 in order to try feature time and 1608755904 == 12/23/2020 in order to try past time).
4. I assumed entrance fee as 10 ether to make things more simple.
5. pragma solidity >=0.7.0 <0.8.0; .
